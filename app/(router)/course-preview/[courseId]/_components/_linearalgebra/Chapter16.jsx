      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Chapter 16: What Are Vectors?</h2>
      <hr className="my-6" />

      <p>
        At the start of this series, I posed a deceptively simple question: <em>What are vectors?</em> In a way, this is one of the most fundamental questions in linear algebra, yet it's surprisingly deep.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine a two-dimensional vector, like the arrow on a flat plane. We can describe this vector using coordinates, say <InlineMath math="(3, 4)" />, as a convenient way to represent its direction and magnitude. Is this vector fundamentally just a list of numbers—3 and 4—like coordinates on a graph? Or is it something deeper? Is the vector more than just a mathematical representation of an arrow, or is it simply the list of real numbers that make up the coordinates? And could both of these ideas be just different manifestations of something deeper and more abstract?
      </p>
      <hr className="my-6" />

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">1. Vectors as Lists of Numbers</h3>
      <p>
        This is clear-cut and simple. We can say a two-dimensional vector is just the list of real numbers <InlineMath math="[x, y]" />, where <InlineMath math="x" /> is the horizontal component and <InlineMath math="y" /> is the vertical component. From this perspective, vectors are abstract objects, not necessarily tied to space or geometry. This abstraction makes it possible to talk about vectors in higher dimensions, like four-dimensional vectors or even 100-dimensional vectors.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-6" />

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">2. Vectors as Spatial Objects (Arrows in Space)</h3>
      <p>
        The second perspective is geometric. Here, we think of vectors as arrows with a specific direction and magnitude. A vector in 2D can be visualized as an arrow pointing from the origin <InlineMath math="(0, 0)" /> to the point <InlineMath math="(3, 4)" />, and this visualization helps us understand how vectors behave in space. This perspective is closely tied to the idea of physical space and helps us interpret vector operations like addition and scaling in a geometric context.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both of these views—vectors as lists of numbers and vectors as arrows in space—feel different, but they both point to the same underlying object. But what if there is something deeper? What if vectors, at their core, are abstract objects that exist independently of the coordinate system or geometric representation we impose on them?
      </p>
      <hr className="my-6" />

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">The Key Insight: A Vector is Not Its Coordinates</h3>
      <p>
        One of the key insights in linear algebra is that vectors exist in a space that is independent of any particular coordinate system. The space itself has certain properties, but the coordinates we use to describe the vectors are arbitrary and can change depending on how we choose to represent them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think about how we use different bases to describe vectors in higher dimensions. In 2D space, we might choose the standard basis <InlineMath math="(1, 0)" /> and <InlineMath math="(0, 1)" /> to describe vectors, but we could just as easily choose another set of basis vectors, like <InlineMath math="(1, 1)" /> and <InlineMath math="(1, -1)" />. The vector itself doesn’t change—just the way we represent it changes. This shows that vectors are independent of the coordinate system, and their "essence" lies in the space they inhabit, not in the specific coordinates we use to describe them.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-6" />

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">The Role of Functions: Functions as Vectors</h3>
      <p>
        To understand this abstraction more clearly, let’s move to something that might not seem related at first—<strong>functions</strong>. In fact, functions can be thought of as vectors, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine you have two functions, <InlineMath math="f" /> and <InlineMath math="g" />. Just like with vectors, we can <strong>add</strong> these functions. The result of adding <InlineMath math="f" /> and <InlineMath math="g" /> is a new function that, at any input <InlineMath math="x" />, gives the sum of the outputs of <InlineMath math="f" /> and <InlineMath math="g" /> at that point:
        <BlockMath math="(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)" />
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, you can <strong>scale</strong> a function by multiplying it by a constant. If you multiply the function <InlineMath math="f" /> by a scalar <InlineMath math="c" />, the resulting function <InlineMath math="cf" /> gives <InlineMath math="cf(x)" /> for every input <InlineMath math="x" />.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is very similar to how we treat vectors. We can add vectors coordinate by coordinate, and we can scale vectors by multiplying each coordinate by a scalar. The operations on functions—addition and scaling—mirror those on vectors.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-6" />

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Linear Transformations and Operators</h3>
      <p>
        In linear algebra, we deal with <strong>linear transformations</strong>—functions that transform vectors while preserving the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. For functions, this idea becomes <strong>operators</strong>. A common example is the <strong>derivative</strong>. The derivative of a function takes a function <InlineMath math="f" /> and transforms it into another function <InlineMath math="f'" />, and it behaves linearly:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          <strong>Additivity</strong>: The derivative of the sum of two functions is the sum of their derivatives:
          <BlockMath math="\frac{d}{dx}(f(x) + g(x)) = \frac{d}{dx}f(x) + \frac{d}{dx}g(x)" />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scaling</strong>: The derivative of a scaled function is the scaled derivative:
          <BlockMath math="\frac{d}{dx}(c f(x)) = c \frac{d}{dx} f(x)" />
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This linearity of the derivative makes it act like a linear transformation, just as matrix-vector multiplication does.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-6" />

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Matrix Representation of the Derivative</h3>
      <p>
        Now, let’s explore the matrix representation of a derivative. This is tricky because function spaces are often infinite-dimensional, meaning they have infinitely many "coordinates." However, we can work with polynomials (which have finite terms) and illustrate the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a polynomial like <InlineMath math="f(x) = x^3 + 5x^2 + 4x + 5" />. We can represent this polynomial as a vector of its coefficients: <InlineMath math="[5, 4, 5, 1, 0, 0, \dots]" /> (with more zeros for higher powers of <InlineMath math="x" />).
      </p>
      <p>
        When we take the derivative of this polynomial, we reduce the degree of each term:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>The derivative of <InlineMath math="x^3" /> is <InlineMath math="3x^2" />.</li>
        <li>The derivative of <InlineMath math="5x^2" /> is <InlineMath math="10x" />.</li>
        <li>The derivative of <InlineMath math="4x" /> is <InlineMath math="4" />.</li>
        <li>The derivative of the constant term <InlineMath math="5" /> is <InlineMath math="0" />.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If we express these derivatives as coefficients, the derivative of the polynomial is represented by a new vector of coefficients. This vector is just the result of multiplying the original vector by a matrix that captures the derivative operation.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-6" />

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">The Generalization: Vector Spaces</h3>
      <p>
        A <strong>vector space</strong> is any collection of objects (such as vectors, functions, or even more abstract things) that follows certain rules, called <strong>axioms</strong>, for vector addition and scalar multiplication.
      </p>
      <p>
        The eight axioms of a vector space ensure that the operations of addition and scaling behave in a predictable way. These axioms are a checklist for mathematicians to verify that a set of objects can indeed be treated as vectors. As long as these rules are satisfied, we can treat the objects as vectors and do all the things with them that we are used to doing with vectors in 2D or 3D space.
