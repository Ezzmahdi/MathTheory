      <hr className="my-4" />
      <p>
        In this chapter, we'll dive into an interesting technique for combining sequences (or series) called summation by parts, and explore the notion of the product of two series. Both of these ideas are incredibly powerful tools for understanding and analyzing series in mathematics. Let's break these concepts down step by step, and explore their use cases and intuition.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">1. Introduction to Series and Sequences</h2>
      <p>
        Before we jump into summation by parts, let’s briefly recall some fundamental definitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        A sequence is an ordered list of numbers, often written as <InlineMath math="a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots" />, where each number is associated with a unique position or index. For example, <InlineMath math="a_n" /> is the <InlineMath math="n" />-th element in the sequence.
      </p>
      <p>
        A series is the sum of the terms of a sequence. If we have a sequence <InlineMath math="a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots" />, the corresponding series is written as:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots" />
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">2. Summation by Parts</h2>
      <p>
        Summation by parts is a technique that allows us to combine two series or sequences in a way that resembles the well-known integration by parts. To understand it, let's recall the basic idea behind integration by parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        In integration by parts, if you want to integrate a product of two functions, say <InlineMath math="u(x)" /> and <InlineMath math="v(x)" />, you use the formula:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="\int u(x) \, dv = u(x) v(x) - \int v(x) \, du(x)" />
      <p>
        This formula essentially tells you how to break down the integration into simpler parts. It’s especially useful when one of the functions is easier to differentiate and the other easier to integrate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, let’s see how summation by parts mimics this process for sums instead of integrals.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">2.1. The Setup</h3>
      <p>
        Consider two sequences <InlineMath math="a_n" /> and <InlineMath math="b_n" />, where both are indexed by <InlineMath math="n" />. We want to study their sum in the form of:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="\sum_{n=P}^{Q} a_n b_n" />
      <p>
        To do this, we first define a new sequence <InlineMath math="A_n" />, which represents the partial sums of the sequence <InlineMath math="a_n" />. The partial sum <InlineMath math="A_n" /> is simply the cumulative sum of the terms of <InlineMath math="a_n" /> up to the <InlineMath math="n" />-th index:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="A_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k" />
      <p>
        We also introduce the convention that <InlineMath math="A_{-1} = 0" /> to make the formula work neatly. This new sequence <InlineMath math="A_n" /> represents the "running total" of the sequence <InlineMath math="a_n" />.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">2.2. Summation by Parts Formula</h3>
      <p>Here is the key result of summation by parts:</p>
      <BlockMath math="\sum_{n=P}^{Q} a_n b_n = A_Q b_Q - A_{P-1} b_P - \sum_{n=P}^{Q-1} A_n (b_{n+1} - b_n)" />
      <p>
        This formula essentially expresses the sum of the products of two sequences as a combination of three parts:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>The difference between the partial sums at the endpoints (i.e., <InlineMath math="A_Q b_Q - A_{P-1} b_P" />),</li>
        <li>The sum of the differences <InlineMath math="b_{n+1} - b_n" /> weighted by the partial sums <InlineMath math="A_n" />.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">2.3. Why is This Like Integration by Parts?</h3>
      <p>
        To understand why this looks like integration by parts, consider the following analogy:
      </p>
      <p>
        In integration by parts, we have two functions: <InlineMath math="u(x)" /> and <InlineMath math="v(x)" />, and the formula transforms the integral into a boundary term <InlineMath math="u(x) v(x)" /> minus another integral <InlineMath math="\int v(x) \, du(x)" />.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, in summation by parts, we have two sequences: <InlineMath math="a_n" /> and <InlineMath math="b_n" />, and we break the sum into a boundary term <InlineMath math="A_Q b_Q - A_{P-1} b_P" /> and a sum of terms involving the differences <InlineMath math="b_{n+1} - b_n" />, weighted by <InlineMath math="A_n" />.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an intuitive connection, as both methods involve expressing the sum or integral as a difference between terms plus a correction factor involving the change in the second sequence.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">2.4. Geometric Interpretation</h3>
      <p>
        Let’s take a step back and look at this formula geometrically. Imagine a square where each side of the square corresponds to the terms in the sequences <InlineMath math="a_n" /> and <InlineMath math="b_n" />. The sum of the products <InlineMath math="a_n b_n" /> is akin to summing the areas of small rectangles formed by these terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case of summation by parts, the idea is that we can split the total area into simpler parts, much like integration by parts allows us to split a complex integral into manageable pieces. This geometric visualization helps understand why we subtract certain terms and add others when applying summation by parts.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">2.5. A Theorem on Convergence</h3>
      <p>
        One of the key results we can derive from summation by parts is related to the convergence of the series. If the sequence <InlineMath math="A_n" /> (the partial sums of <InlineMath math="a_n" />) is bounded, and if <InlineMath math="b_n" /> is a decreasing sequence that approaches zero, then the sum of the series <InlineMath math="\sum a_n b_n" /> converges.
      </p>
      <p>
        This result is often very useful in proving the convergence of series that involve alternating or decreasing terms. The intuition behind this theorem is that the boundedness of <InlineMath math="A_n" /> and the decreasing nature of <InlineMath math="b_n" /> ensures that the series won’t "blow up" and can be controlled.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">3. Example of Applying Summation by Parts</h2>
      <p>
        Let’s apply summation by parts to a specific example. Suppose we have a series where <InlineMath math="a_n" /> represents an alternating sequence (such as <InlineMath math="(-1)^n" />) and <InlineMath math="b_n" /> is a decreasing sequence (such as <InlineMath math="\frac{1}{n}" />):
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="a_n = (-1)^n, \quad b_n = \frac{1}{n}" />
      <p>
        Now, let’s apply the summation by parts formula to evaluate the sum of this series. Since <InlineMath math="A_n" /> (the partial sums of <InlineMath math="(-1)^n" />) is bounded, and <InlineMath math="b_n" /> is decreasing and approaches zero, we can conclude that the series converges, following the theorem we derived.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">4. Product of Two Series</h2>
      <p>
        Another interesting concept in this chapter is the product of two series. While we’re used to adding series term by term, we may also want to multiply two series. The product of two series is defined in a specific way, especially when dealing with power series.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider two power series:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="A(z) = a_0 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2 + \ldots" />
      <BlockMath math="B(z) = b_0 + b_1 z + b_2 z^2 + \ldots" />
      <p>
        The product of these two series is defined as a new series <InlineMath math="C(z)" />, where the coefficients <InlineMath math="c_n" /> are given by:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="c_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k b_{n-k}" />
      <p>
        This definition comes from the idea that each term in the product comes from the sum of all possible products of the terms from <InlineMath math="A(z)" /> and <InlineMath math="B(z)" />. For example:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>The constant term <InlineMath math="c_0" /> is just <InlineMath math="a_0 b_0" />.</li>
        <li>The coefficient of <InlineMath math="z" /> is <InlineMath math="a_1 b_0 + a_0 b_1" />.</li>
        <li>The coefficient of <InlineMath math="z^2" /> is <InlineMath math="a_2 b_0 + a_1 b_1 + a_0 b_2" />.</li>
        <li>And so on.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This definition is crucial in applications like generating functions and Fourier series, where you need to combine the terms of two series in a meaningful way.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">5. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        In this chapter, we explored the powerful concept of summation by parts and how it provides a way to manipulate series by breaking them down into simpler components. We also touched on the concept of the product of two series, which has applications in areas like power series and generating functions. By using these tools, we can better understand the convergence of series and handle more complex series combinations with ease.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope this chapter provided you with a solid understanding of these techniques and their applications. As we move forward, we’ll continue to build on these ideas and explore more advanced topics in the study of series and sequences.
