      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Chapter 22: Uniform Continuity</h2>
      <p className="mt-4">
        This chapter introduces essential concepts in topology and analysis, specifically focusing on <strong>continuity</strong>, <strong>compactness</strong>, and the <strong>Leig Covering Lemma</strong>. These topics help us understand how spaces behave when we apply continuous functions to them and how their geometric properties are analyzed. Letâ€™s explore these ideas step by step.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1. Introductory Concepts of Continuity</h3>
      <p>
        To understand continuity in the context of metric spaces, let's start with a simple idea. Consider two points, <strong>p</strong> and <strong>q</strong>, in a metric space, and a function <InlineMath math="f" /> that maps points from one space to another. The function <InlineMath math="f" /> is continuous if, whenever the points <InlineMath math="p" /> and <InlineMath math="q" /> are close to each other, their images <InlineMath math="f(p)" /> and <InlineMath math="f(q)" /> are also close.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mt-4">
        <li>
          If <InlineMath math="p" /> and <InlineMath math="q" /> are near each other in space (in terms of distance), their images under <InlineMath math="f" /> will also be close. This means that the function <InlineMath math="f" /> does not "break" or "jump" between points that are near each other.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mt-4">
        This property becomes crucial when we work with <strong>compact spaces</strong>. Compactness has to do with covering spaces with smaller sets, and continuity ensures that small distances are preserved when mapping between spaces.
      </p>

      <hr className="my-6" />

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2. The Leig Covering Lemma</h3>
      <p>
        A powerful tool in topology is the <strong>Leig Covering Lemma</strong>, which deals with compact metric spaces. The lemma states that if we cover a compact space with open sets, we can find small enough neighborhoods around each point in the space that are contained entirely within some open set of the cover.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Visualize this: you have a compact space <InlineMath math="X" /> and a collection of open sets that cover it. The Leig Covering Lemma guarantees that there exists a small enough ball (called a <strong>Delta ball</strong>) around each point in <InlineMath math="X" />, which is entirely contained within one of the covering sets.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        This lemma is significant because it ensures that compact spaces are "manageable" when covered by open sets, making them easier to work with mathematically.
      </p>

      <hr className="my-6" />

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3. Compactness and the Leig Number</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Compactness</strong> refers to spaces where every open cover has a finite subcover. This means that a compact space can be covered by a finite number of open sets, which is a powerful property.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mt-4">
        <li>
          The <strong>Leig number</strong> is related to the compactness of a space. It gives us a radius (denoted <InlineMath math="\Delta" />) such that any ball of radius <InlineMath math="\Delta" /> around a point will lie completely within one of the open sets in the cover.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mt-4">
        By applying the Leig Covering Lemma, we can show that such a radius exists, ensuring that the compact space behaves in a controlled way under continuous maps.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4. The Role of Continuity in Connected Sets</h3>
      <p>
        Another key result in topology is the preservation of connectedness by continuous functions. If a space <InlineMath math="X" /> is connected, and we apply a continuous function <InlineMath math="f" /> from <InlineMath math="X" /> to another space <InlineMath math="Y" />, then the image of any connected subset of <InlineMath math="X" /> will also be connected.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        This is intuitive: a continuous function cannot break a connected set into two disconnected pieces. For example, if you have a piece of string that is connected, pulling it smoothly will not disconnect it.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5. The Power of Continuity and Compactness</h3>
      <p>
        In conclusion, the combination of <strong>compactness</strong>, <strong>uniform continuity</strong>, and the <strong>Leig Covering Lemma</strong> gives us powerful tools for analyzing spaces in mathematics. These concepts allow us to study how spaces behave under continuous functions, ensuring that we can cover spaces efficiently and preserve properties like connectedness.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8">6. Uniform Continuity</h2>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Definition:</h3>
      <p>
        A function <InlineMath math="f: X \rightarrow Y" /> is said to be <strong>uniformly continuous</strong> if for every <InlineMath math="\epsilon > 0" />, there exists a <InlineMath math="\delta > 0" /> such that for all <InlineMath math="x_1, x_2 \in X" />, if <InlineMath math="d_X(x_1, x_2) < \delta" />, then <InlineMath math="d_Y(f(x_1), f(x_2)) < \epsilon" />.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        This definition means that the function behaves consistently across the entire space. Specifically, there is a single <InlineMath math="\delta" /> that works for <strong>all</strong> points in the domain, which is what makes <strong>uniform continuity</strong> stronger than regular continuity.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Importance:</h3>
      <p>
        Uniform continuity ensures that the rate of change of a function is controlled uniformly across its entire domain. This is especially useful in analysis because it ensures that the function behaves in a predictable way at every point in the space.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Key Theorem:</h3>
      <p>
        If a function is continuous on a compact set, then it is <strong>uniformly continuous</strong>. This theorem is significant because it links the idea of compactness with uniform continuity, showing that compact sets always ensure uniformity in the behavior of continuous functions.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Examples:</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mt-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Uniformly Continuous Example</strong>: The function <InlineMath math="f(x) = x^2" /> is uniformly continuous on any closed interval <InlineMath math="[a, b]" /> because the interval is compact. However, it is <strong>not</strong> uniformly continuous on the entire real line <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}" />, because the function grows too rapidly as <InlineMath math="x" /> increases.
        </li>
        <li className="mt-2">
          <strong>Non-uniform Continuity Example</strong>: The function <InlineMath math="f(x) = x^2" /> on <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}" /> is not uniformly continuous because there is no single <InlineMath math="\delta" /> that works for all points as the values of <InlineMath math="x" /> grow larger.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Applications:</h3>
      <p>
        Uniform continuity plays a key role in areas like integration and differentiation. When functions are uniformly continuous, we can ensure that their behavior is predictable and stable across their entire domain, which simplifies many proofs in real analysis.
