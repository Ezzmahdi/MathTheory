      <p className="mb-4">
        Welcome back! In the previous chapters, we discussed the derivative, which helps us understand how a function changes at any point. We also learned about the Mean Value Theorem (MVT), which links the average rate of change of a function over an interval to the instantaneous rate of change at some point within that interval. Today, we’ll dive deeper into an important concept, <strong>Taylor’s Theorem</strong>, which builds on what we’ve already learned, allowing us to approximate complex functions using simpler polynomials. We’ll also explore how sequences of functions behave, especially focusing on <strong>convergence</strong> and how different types of convergence affect the functions we work with.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">25.1 The Road from the Mean Value Theorem to Taylor's Theorem</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To understand Taylor’s Theorem, let’s first recall the <strong>Mean Value Theorem</strong> (MVT):
        For a function <InlineMath math="f" /> that is continuous on the interval <InlineMath math="[a, b]" /> and differentiable on the open interval <InlineMath math="(a, b)" />, there exists a point <InlineMath math="c \in (a, b)" /> such that:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="f(b) = f(a) + f'(c)(b - a)" />

      <p className="mb-4">
        The MVT tells us that the change in the function’s value between two points <InlineMath math="a" /> and <InlineMath math="b" /> can be approximated by the derivative at some point <InlineMath math="c" />. This gives us a <strong>first-order approximation</strong> of the function’s behavior. But is there a way to get a better approximation? Absolutely!
      </p>

      <hr className="border-t-2 border-gray-300 my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">A Generalization: Approximating <InlineMath math="f(b)" /> More Accurately</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To improve this approximation, we use <strong>Taylor’s Theorem</strong>, which involves higher-order derivatives of the function. The more derivatives we use, the closer our approximation gets to the actual value of the function.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        For example, by using the first and second derivatives, we can refine our approximation like this:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="f(b) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(b - a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(b - a)^2" />

      <p className="mb-4">
        Here, we start with the function's value at <InlineMath math="a" /> and add terms based on the function’s rate of change (derivatives) at <InlineMath math="a" />. Adding more derivatives and terms will allow us to better approximate the function’s value at <InlineMath math="b" />.
      </p>

      <hr className="border-t-2 border-gray-300 my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">25.2 Taylor Polynomials: Building Blocks of Approximation</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Now, let's formalize this process. Suppose <InlineMath math="f(x)" /> is a function that has derivatives up to the <InlineMath math="n" />-th order at a point <InlineMath math="a" />. The <strong>Taylor polynomial</strong> of degree <InlineMath math="n-1" />, centered at <InlineMath math="a" />, is given by:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="P_{n-1}(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x - a)^2 + \cdots + \frac{f^{(n-1)}(a)}{(n-1)!}(x - a)^{n-1}" />

      <p className="mb-4">
        This polynomial is a <strong>best-fit approximation</strong> of the function <InlineMath math="f(x)" /> near the point <InlineMath math="a" />. The closer <InlineMath math="x" /> is to <InlineMath math="a" />, the better the approximation will be.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">How It Works:</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>The first term, <InlineMath math="f(a)" />, gives us the value of the function at <InlineMath math="a" />.</li>
        <li>The second term, <InlineMath math="f'(a)(x - a)" />, gives us the slope of the function at <InlineMath math="a" />.</li>
        <li>The third term, <InlineMath math="\frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x - a)^2" />, adds curvature (how the slope changes at <InlineMath math="a" />).</li>
        <li>Adding more terms improves the approximation by capturing more details about the function’s behavior.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr className="border-t-2 border-gray-300 my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">25.3 Convergence of Functions and Uniform Convergence in Metric Spaces</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Now that we understand how Taylor polynomials work, let’s shift gears a bit. Taylor’s Theorem allows us to approximate functions, but what happens when we have a <strong>sequence of functions</strong>? Do they always converge to a single function as we take more terms? And if they do, under what conditions does this happen?
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In mathematics, we often think of functions as <strong>points</strong> in a space, much like how you can think of a point on a graph. We can define how "close" two functions are by measuring the <strong>distance</strong> between them. When we have a sequence of functions, we want to know if, as we add more and more functions, they approach a specific limiting function.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Pointwise Convergence</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Pointwise convergence</strong> is one way to describe this. A sequence of functions <InlineMath math="F_n(x)" /> converges pointwise to a function <InlineMath math="f(x)" /> if, for every point <InlineMath math="x" /> in the domain, the sequence of values <InlineMath math="F_n(x)" /> approaches <InlineMath math="f(x)" /> as <InlineMath math="n" /> gets larger. In other words, at each individual point, the sequence gets closer to the limiting function.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        For example, consider the sequence of functions:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="F_n(x) = x^n" />

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>If <InlineMath math="x \in [0, 1)" />, then as <InlineMath math="n" /> increases, <InlineMath math="F_n(x) \to 0" />.</li>
        <li>If <InlineMath math="x = 1" />, then <InlineMath math="F_n(1) = 1" /> for all <InlineMath math="n" />, so <InlineMath math="F_n(x)" /> stays at 1.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Thus, the <strong>pointwise limit</strong> of this sequence is:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="f(x) = \begin{cases} 0, & \text{if } x \in [0, 1) \\ 1, & \text{if } x = 1 \end{cases}" />

      <hr className="border-t-2 border-gray-300 my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Uniform Convergence</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        While pointwise convergence is useful, it’s often not strong enough to guarantee that properties like continuity are preserved. This is where <strong>uniform convergence</strong> comes in.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A sequence of functions <InlineMath math="F_n(x)" /> converges <strong>uniformly</strong> to a function <InlineMath math="f(x)" /> if, no matter how close we want <InlineMath math="F_n(x)" /> to get to <InlineMath math="f(x)" />, there’s a single point <InlineMath math="N" /> such that for all <InlineMath math="n > N" />, and for all <InlineMath math="x" /> in the domain, the difference between <InlineMath math="F_n(x)" /> and <InlineMath math="f(x)" /> is smaller than any given <InlineMath math="\epsilon > 0" />.
      </p>

      <hr className="border-t-2 border-gray-300 my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">25.4 Limitations of Pointwise Convergence</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Although pointwise convergence is a useful concept, it has its <strong>limitations</strong>. For instance, if the functions in the sequence are continuous, their pointwise limit might not be continuous. In other words, pointwise convergence doesn't necessarily preserve the properties of the functions.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Uniform Convergence: A Stronger Notion</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To get around these limitations, we introduce <strong>uniform convergence</strong>. A sequence of functions <InlineMath math="F_n(x)" /> converges uniformly to a function <InlineMath math="f(x)" /> if, for every <InlineMath math="\epsilon > 0" />, there exists an integer <InlineMath math="N" /> such that for all <InlineMath math="n \geq N" /> and for all <InlineMath math="x" />, the difference <InlineMath math="|F_n(x) - f(x)| < \epsilon" />. This means that as <InlineMath math="n" /> gets larger, the whole sequence of functions is uniformly close to the limiting function.
      </p>

      <hr className="border-t-2 border-gray-300 my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">25.5 Taylor’s Theorem: The Precise Approximation</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Now that we understand convergence, let's revisit <strong>Taylor's Theorem</strong>. This theorem extends the ideas behind the MVT and provides a way to approximate functions using polynomials and calculate how accurate our approximations are.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        For a function <InlineMath math="f(x)" /> that is <InlineMath math="n" />-times differentiable, we can express <InlineMath math="f(x)" /> as:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="f(x) = P_{n-1}(x) + R_n(x)" />

      <p className="mb-4">
        where <InlineMath math="P_{n-1}(x)" /> is the Taylor polynomial and <InlineMath math="R_n(x)" /> is the <strong>remainder term</strong>, which gives us the <strong>error</strong> of the approximation. The error can be written as:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n)}(c)}{n!}(x - a)^n" />

      <p className="mb-4">
        for some <InlineMath math="c" /> between <InlineMath math="a" /> and <InlineMath math="x" />. This error term allows us to quantify how close our approximation is to the true function.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Special Case: <InlineMath math="n = 1" /></h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        When <InlineMath math="n = 1" />, Taylor’s Theorem simplifies to the <strong>Mean Value Theorem</strong>, which tells us that:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="f(x) = f(a) + f'(c)(x - a)" />

      <p className="mb-4">
        This shows that the MVT is just a special case of Taylor’s Theorem for the first derivative.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">25.6 Visualizing Taylor Polynomials</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To better understand how Taylor polynomials approximate a function, imagine looking at a curve. If you zoom in on the curve near the point <InlineMath math="a" />, it starts to look more like a straight line—the tangent line. This is the first-order approximation. As you add more derivatives, the polynomial becomes a better fit, capturing the curvature and finer details of the function.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li><strong>First-order</strong>: The tangent line.</li>
        <li><strong>Second-order</strong>: Adds curvature.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-order and beyond</strong>: Matches the function even more precisely.</li>
      </ul>
