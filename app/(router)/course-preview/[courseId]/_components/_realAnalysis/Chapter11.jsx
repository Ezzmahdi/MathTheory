        Chapter 11: Compactness in Metric Spaces
      </h2>
      <hr className="my-4" />
      <p className="mb-6">
        In this chapter, we'll explore the concept of <strong>compactness</strong> in metric spaces, which is an
        important idea in mathematical analysis. The goal is to break down the definition of compactness in an
        accessible way, explain its properties, and relate it to concepts you're already familiar with. We'll use a
        step-by-step approach to make sure that everything is clear and easy to understand. So let's get started!
      </p>

      <hr className="my-4" />
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Introduction to Compactness</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Compactness is a property of sets in a metric space that generalizes the idea of a set being "small" or
        "limited" in a certain sense. Compact sets are important because they have nice properties that make them
        easier to work with, such as the ability to find limits of sequences or ensure certain behaviors in
        mathematical problems.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To understand compactness, we need to look at two key properties:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Boundedness</strong>: A set is bounded if it doesn't stretch infinitely far in any direction. In
          other words, all points in the set are within a certain distance of each other.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Closedness</strong>: A set is closed if it contains all of its boundary points. This means if you
          keep adding points that are "close" to the set, the set doesn't "open up" and leave out any points.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        When we say a set is compact, we are saying that it is both <strong>bounded</strong> and <strong>closed</strong> in a specific way that makes it behave nicely in a metric space.
      </p>

      <hr className="my-4" />
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. A Visual Understanding of Compactness</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Imagine you're playing a game where you have 17 balls (representing points) placed in a space. Each ball is
        centered at a point, and the distance between any two points is measured.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>How far apart can these balls be from one another?</li>
        <li>What if the balls are scattered in such a way that they don't form a neat structure?</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        At first glance, this may seem complicated. But if we think about all the pairwise distances (the distances
        between each pair of points), there are only finitely many different distances. In other words, the
        distances between points are limited.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The <strong>maximum distance</strong> between two points can be computed, and we can define a large enough
        ball around any given point that will contain all other points within it. This approach helps us deal with
        situations where the points might appear disconnected.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> A compact set is a set where all distances between points are limited (bounded),
        and we can always find a "large enough ball" around any point that contains all other points in the set.
      </p>

      <hr className="my-4" />
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. The Triangle Inequality and Compactness</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To formalize this idea, we use a tool from geometry called the <strong>triangle inequality</strong>. This
        property says that the distance between two points is always less than or equal to the sum of the distances
        between intermediate points. In simpler terms:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math=" \text{Distance between } A \text{ and } C \leq \text{Distance between } A \text{ and } B + \text{Distance between } B \text{ and } C " />
      <p className="mb-4">
        By applying the triangle inequality, we can prove that if we have a compact set, all distances between the
        points can be bounded by a specific maximum value.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        For example, if we know the maximum distance between any two points, we can use the triangle inequality to
        prove that all points are within a "safe" distance from each other. This helps us manage disconnected points
        or points that are far apart.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The triangle inequality lets us understand the maximum distance between points
        in a set, helping us define the boundaries of compact sets more clearly.
      </p>

      <hr className="my-4" />
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Compactness in General Metric Spaces</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Now, let’s explore the idea that compactness is not dependent on the specific space you're working in.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In previous chapters, we've seen how certain properties like being <strong>open</strong> or <strong>closed</strong>
        depend on the space the set is embedded in. For instance, a set might be open in one space but not in another if
        the space’s structure changes (e.g., moving from <InlineMath math=" \mathbb{R}^1 " /> to <InlineMath math=" \mathbb{R}^2 " />).
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        However, <strong>compactness</strong> behaves differently. It's a property that depends only on the set itself, not
        on the metric space it is part of. This means that a set can be compact in one space and still be compact in
        another space, as long as the set doesn’t change.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Compactness is an intrinsic property of the set, which doesn’t depend on the space
        it's in.
      </p>

      <hr className="my-4" />
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Relative Open Sets and Compactness</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To fully understand compactness, we need to look at how sets behave when we embed them in larger spaces.
        Consider the idea of <strong>relative openness</strong>. A set may be open in one space but not in another,
        especially when we embed the set into a bigger space.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        For example, consider a set <InlineMath math=" Y " /> that is a subset of a larger metric space <InlineMath math=" X " />.
        If we are considering whether a set in <InlineMath math=" Y " /> is open, we need to check whether the set can
        be "contained" within the larger space <InlineMath math=" X " />. The relationship between open sets in <InlineMath math=" Y " />
        and <InlineMath math=" X " /> becomes important when we talk about compactness in these embedded spaces.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Let’s define the idea of <strong>relative open sets</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>
          A set <InlineMath math=" U " /> is <strong>open relative to Y</strong> if every point in <InlineMath math=" U " />
          has a neighborhood that is contained within <InlineMath math=" U " /> when we restrict to the metric of <InlineMath math=" Y " />.
        </li>
        <li>
          A set <InlineMath math=" U " /> is <strong>open in X</strong> if it can be represented as a union of open balls in <InlineMath math=" X " />.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-6">
        The key is that the openness in <InlineMath math=" Y " /> depends on the openness in <InlineMath math=" X " />, but the set
        itself can still be compact in both spaces.
      </p>

      <hr className="my-4" />
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">6. The Criterion for Relative Openness</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The key theorem we’ll discuss here helps us understand when a set is open in a subspace <InlineMath math=" Y " />.
        It tells us that a set <InlineMath math=" E " /> is open in <InlineMath math=" Y " /> if and only if it is the
        intersection of an open set in <InlineMath math=" X " /> with <InlineMath math=" Y " />.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In simpler terms:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>If <InlineMath math=" E " /> is open in <InlineMath math=" Y " />, it means we can find an open set in <InlineMath math=" X " /> that intersects <InlineMath math=" Y " /> to form <InlineMath math=" E " />.</li>
        <li>The reverse is also true: If <InlineMath math=" E " /> is the intersection of an open set in <InlineMath math=" X " /> and <InlineMath math=" Y " />, then <InlineMath math=" E " /> is open in <InlineMath math=" Y " />.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-6">
        This relationship allows us to pass between open sets in a smaller space and open sets in a larger space.
      </p>

      <hr className="my-4" />
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">7. Compactness and Metric Spaces</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        So, after understanding these relationships, we now conclude that compactness is not affected by the larger
        space the set is in. If a set <InlineMath math=" K " /> is compact in a space <InlineMath math=" X " />, it is
        also compact in any subspace <InlineMath math=" Y " /> that contains <InlineMath math=" K " />.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        This is an important result because it shows that compactness is a fundamental property that doesn’t change
        when we embed the set in a larger space.
      </p>

      <hr className="my-4" />
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">8. Conclusion</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In this chapter, we have carefully explored the idea of compactness in metric spaces. We started by
        understanding its basic properties—boundedness and closedness—and then moved on to more advanced ideas, like
        the triangle inequality and the relative openness of sets. By understanding how compactness works in different
        metric spaces, we’ve shown that compactness is a powerful, intrinsic property of sets that holds no matter
        where the set is located.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        <strong>Key Takeaways:</strong>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
          <li>A compact set is both bounded and closed in a way that behaves like a finite set.</li>
          <li>Compactness is an intrinsic property of a set, independent of the larger metric space it resides in.</li>
          <li>Understanding how openness works in subspaces is crucial to understanding compactness in different spaces.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Next time, we will explore more examples of compact sets and further refine our understanding of how compactness
        relates to other topological concepts. Stay tuned!
