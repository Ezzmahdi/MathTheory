      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Basis for a Topology</h2>

      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">1.1 What is a Topology?</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">
        A <strong>topology</strong> on a set <InlineMath math="X" /> is a collection of subsets of <InlineMath math="X" /> called <strong>open sets</strong>. These open sets help us describe the structure of the space and its properties like continuity, convergence, and connectedness. A topology is a formal mathematical way to study spaces and functions.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        To define a topology on <InlineMath math="X" />, the collection of open sets must satisfy three key properties:
      </p>

      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-6">
        <li>
          The entire set and the empty set must be open: That is, <InlineMath math="X" /> and <InlineMath math="\emptyset" /> (the empty set) are always part of the collection of open sets.
        </li>
        <li>
          The union of any collection of open sets must also be open: If you take any number of open sets (even infinitely many), their union must also be an open set.
        </li>
        <li>
          The intersection of any finite number of open sets must be open: If you take two or more open sets and find their intersection, it must also be an open set.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p className="mb-6">
        These conditions ensure that we can talk about continuous functions and other key ideas in topology.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">1.2 What is a Basis for a Topology?</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">
        A <strong>basis</strong> for a topology on <InlineMath math="X" /> is a collection of subsets of <InlineMath math="X" /> from which all open sets in the topology can be constructed. The basis elements are the "building blocks" of open sets. Instead of defining each open set individually, we can generate them by taking unions of basis elements.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        For a collection <InlineMath math="\mathcal{B}" /> to be a basis for a topology, it must satisfy two conditions:
      </p>

      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Covering Condition:</strong> Every point in <InlineMath math="X" /> must be contained in at least one of the basis elements. In other words, the union of all the basis sets must cover <InlineMath math="X" />.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Intersection Condition:</strong> If two basis elements <InlineMath math="B_1" /> and <InlineMath math="B_2" /> intersect, their intersection must be "recovered" by a basis element. Specifically, for any point in <InlineMath math="B_1 \cap B_2" />, there must be a basis element <InlineMath math="B_3" /> that contains the point and is fully contained within <InlineMath math="B_1 \cap B_2" />.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p className="mb-6">
        This way, the topology is built using unions of these basis elements, making it easier to describe and work with.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">1.3 Why is a Basis Important?</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">
        The concept of a basis is powerful because it simplifies the process of defining open sets. Once we have a basis, we can generate all the open sets in the topology by taking unions of these basis elements.
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li><strong>Open Sets:</strong> Every open set in the topology is a union of basis elements. This allows us to describe any open set as a combination of simpler pieces.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Structure:</strong> The basis elements give us a way to study the space locally. That is, they tell us about the "neighborhoods" around points in the space.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        By focusing on a basis, we avoid the complexity of having to define each open set directly.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">1.4 Examples of Bases</h3>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Euclidean Space:</strong> In <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}^n" />, a common basis is the collection of <strong>open balls</strong> <InlineMath math="B(x, r)" />, where each ball is a set of points within a distance <InlineMath math="r" /> of a point <InlineMath math="x" />.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Intervals in <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}" />:</strong> In the real line <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}" />, a natural basis is the collection of <strong>open intervals</strong> <InlineMath math="(a, b)" />, where <InlineMath math="a < b" />. Any open set in <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}" /> can be written as a union of such intervals.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">1.5 Countability of a Basis</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">
        A space is <strong>second countable</strong> if there exists a countable basis for its topology. This means that you can find a countable collection of open sets (a countable basis) that can generate all open sets in the topology. Spaces with a countable basis are easier to work with because the "size" of the collection of open sets is countable, making it simpler to study the space.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Connectedness</h2>

      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">2.1 What is Connectedness?</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">
        A set is <strong>connected</strong> if it cannot be divided into two non-empty, disjoint open sets. Intuitively, this means that the set is "in one piece." If you try to break it into two parts, there will always be some "connection" between them. If you can separate the set into two non-empty disjoint open sets, the set is <strong>disconnected</strong>.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        For example:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li><strong>A connected set:</strong> The interval <InlineMath math="[a, b]" /> in <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}" /> is connected because you cannot split it into two parts that are not connected to each other. No matter how you divide the interval, there will always be some overlap.</li>
        <li><strong>A disconnected set:</strong> The set <InlineMath math="A = [0, 1] \cup [2, 3]" /> is disconnected because it can be split into the two disjoint sets <InlineMath math="[0, 1]" /> and <InlineMath math="[2, 3]" />.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">2.2 Separation of Sets</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Two sets <InlineMath math="A" /> and <InlineMath math="B" /> are said to be <strong>separated</strong> if they do not overlap and, even when considering their closure (which includes their limit points), they remain disjoint. Specifically:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li><InlineMath math="A \cap B = \emptyset" /> (the sets do not overlap),</li>
        <li><InlineMath math="\overline{A} \cap B = \emptyset" /> (the closure of <InlineMath math="A" /> does not intersect <InlineMath math="B" />),</li>
        <li><InlineMath math="\overline{B} \cap A = \emptyset" /> (the closure of <InlineMath math="B" /> does not intersect <InlineMath math="A" />).</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        This means that not only do the sets not overlap, but there are also no limit points from one set "creeping" into the other set.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">2.3 Proof of Connectedness</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        To prove that a set <InlineMath math="X" /> is connected, we assume the opposite â€” that <InlineMath math="X" /> can be separated into two non-empty disjoint sets, say <InlineMath math="A" /> and <InlineMath math="B" />. If we assume that <InlineMath math="X = A \cup B" />, we must show that this leads to a contradiction. For example, any point on the boundary of <InlineMath math="A" /> must either lie in <InlineMath math="A" /> or <InlineMath math="B" />, and if there is overlap or boundary points shared by both, we can demonstrate that <InlineMath math="A" /> and <InlineMath math="B" /> were not disjoint, thus proving the connectedness of <InlineMath math="X" />.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">2.4 Examples of Connected and Disconnected Sets</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Connected Set:</strong> The interval <InlineMath math="[a, b]" /> in <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}" /> is connected because it cannot be split into two disjoint sets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Disconnected Set:</strong> The set <InlineMath math="A = [0, 1] \cup [2, 3]" /> is disconnected because we can clearly separate it into two disjoint parts: <InlineMath math="[0, 1]" /> and <InlineMath math="[2, 3]" />.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Compactness</h2>

      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">3.1 What is Compactness?</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        A set is <strong>compact</strong> if it satisfies the following condition: <strong>every open cover of the set has a finite subcover</strong>. This means that if we cover the set with a collection of open sets, we can always find a finite number of those open sets that still cover the entire set.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        In simpler terms, compactness ensures that a set is "small" in a certain sense. No matter how we cover it with open sets, we only need a finite number of them to cover it fully.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        <strong>Intuitive Example:</strong> Imagine covering a region of a map with open intervals. If the region is compact, you can always find a finite number of intervals that still cover the entire region, no matter how many intervals you start with.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">3.2 The Finite Intersection Property (FIP)</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        The <strong>Finite Intersection Property (FIP)</strong> states that if you have a collection of compact sets and every finite subcollection of them has a non-empty intersection, then the intersection of all the sets must also be non-empty. This property is important in understanding compact sets in terms of intersections of closed sets.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">3.3 Characterization of Compactness</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        In metric spaces, a set is compact if and only if it is <strong>closed</strong> and <strong>bounded</strong>. This is a result of the <strong>Heine-Borel Theorem</strong>, which holds in Euclidean spaces like <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}^n" />. This result connects compactness to the more familiar ideas of closed and bounded sets:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li><strong>Closed:</strong> The set contains all its limit points.</li>
        <li><strong>Bounded:</strong> The set is contained within a finite region of space.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">3.4 Cantor Set Construction</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        The <strong>Cantor set</strong> is a classic example of a compact set. It is constructed by repeatedly removing the middle third of each interval in the interval <InlineMath math="[0, 1]" />. After infinitely many steps, the remaining points form the Cantor set. Despite being constructed through infinite steps, the Cantor set has some surprising properties:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>It is <strong>closed</strong> (contains all its limit points).</li>
        <li>It is <strong>compact</strong>.</li>
        <li>It is <strong>nowhere dense</strong>, meaning it has no intervals of positive length.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">3.5 Compactness in Non-Euclidean Spaces</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Compactness is not limited to Euclidean spaces. In general, compact sets in arbitrary metric spaces have similar properties. In particular, a compact set in any metric space is always closed and bounded.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">3.6 Compactness and Continuity</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Compactness is important when studying continuous functions. A key result is that <strong>a continuous function defined on a compact set is always bounded and attains its maximum and minimum</strong> (the <strong>Extreme Value Theorem</strong>). This makes compact sets very useful in analysis and optimization.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">3.7 Examples of Compact and Non-Compact Sets</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Compact Set:</strong> The closed interval <InlineMath math="[a, b]" /> in <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}" /> is compact because it is both closed and bounded, and it satisfies the open cover condition.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Non-Compact Set:</strong> The open interval <InlineMath math="(a, b)" /> in <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}" /> is not compact because it is not closed (it does not contain its boundary points).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <p className="mt-6">
        This chapter has explored the foundational ideas of topology, connectedness, and compactness, giving a deeper understanding of the mathematical structures that underlie metric spaces. These concepts play a crucial role in more advanced studies in analysis, geometry, and many other fields.
