      <hr className="my-4" />

      <p className="mb-6">
        In this chapter, we delve into the concept of <strong>compactness</strong>, a fundamental property in topology and analysis. Compactness generalizes the notion of closed and bounded subsets in Euclidean spaces and provides a crucial framework for understanding convergence, continuity, and boundedness in more abstract settings.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Compactness in <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}^n" /></h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Let’s begin with the familiar setting of <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}^n" />. Recall the <strong>Heine-Borel Theorem</strong>, which states that a subset <InlineMath math="K \subset \mathbb{R}^n" /> is compact if and only if it is:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-decimal list-inside mb-6">
        <li><strong>Closed</strong>, and</li>
        <li><strong>Bounded</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        This characterization is specific to <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}^n" />, where the concepts of closed and bounded sets are straightforward to understand.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Compactness in Metric Spaces: A New Characterization</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Compactness can be described differently in arbitrary <strong>metric spaces</strong>. One powerful characterization of compactness is:
      </p>
      <blockquote className="border-l-4 pl-4 mb-6 italic">
        <strong>Theorem:</strong> A set <InlineMath math="K" /> in a metric space is compact if and only if every infinite subset of <InlineMath math="K" /> has a limit point in <InlineMath math="K" />.
      </blockquote>

      <p className="mb-6">
        This statement is both intuitive and profound. To grasp its significance, consider what it means for a set to be "small" or "tight." A compact set, despite possibly containing infinitely many points, behaves like a finite set in the sense that every infinite subset "accumulates" somewhere within the set.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Intuition Behind the Theorem</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Imagine trying to fit infinitely many points into a "small" set. If the set is compact, these points cannot just spread out indefinitely; they must cluster around some point within the set. This clustering is what we call <strong>limit points</strong>. Conversely, if a set allows points to drift apart infinitely without clustering, it cannot be compact.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Proof: Compactness and Limit Points</h2>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">a. Forward Direction</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">
        <strong>If <InlineMath math="K" /> is compact, then every infinite subset of <InlineMath math="K" /> has a limit point in <InlineMath math="K" />.</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        <strong>Proof</strong> (by contradiction):
      </p>
      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-6">
        <li>Assume <InlineMath math="K" /> is compact but there exists an infinite subset <InlineMath math="E \subset K" /> with no limit point in <InlineMath math="K" />.</li>
        <li>Since <InlineMath math="E" /> has no limit point, for each point <InlineMath math="q \in E" />, we can find a neighborhood <InlineMath math="V_q" /> around <InlineMath math="q" /> that excludes all other points of <InlineMath math="E" />.</li>
        <li>These neighborhoods <InlineMath math="{V_q : q \in E}" /> form an <strong>open cover</strong> of <InlineMath math="E" />, but since <InlineMath math="E" /> is infinite and the neighborhoods exclude each other, no finite subcollection can cover <InlineMath math="E" />.</li>
      </ol>

      <p className="mb-6">
        This contradicts compactness, as compact sets require every open cover to have a <strong>finite subcover</strong>. Thus, every infinite subset of <InlineMath math="K" /> must have a limit point.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">b. Reverse Direction</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">
        <strong>If every infinite subset of <InlineMath math="K" /> has a limit point in <InlineMath math="K" />, then <InlineMath math="K" /> is compact.</strong>
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        For metric spaces like <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}^n" />, we’ll leverage the Heine-Borel Theorem. We need to show that <InlineMath math="K" /> is both closed and bounded:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li><strong>Boundedness:</strong> Assume <InlineMath math="K" /> is not bounded. Then we can construct an infinite subset of <InlineMath math="K" /> that "escapes" to infinity (e.g., <InlineMath math="x_n" /> with <InlineMath math="\|x_n\| > n" />). This subset would have no limit point in <InlineMath math="K" />, contradicting the hypothesis.</li>
        <li><strong>Closedness:</strong> Assume <InlineMath math="K" /> is not closed, so there exists a point <InlineMath math="p \notin K" /> that is a limit point of <InlineMath math="K" />. Then we can construct a sequence in <InlineMath math="K" /> converging to <InlineMath math="p" />, which contradicts the assumption that every infinite subset's limit point lies within <InlineMath math="K" />.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        A notable corollary of this result is the <strong>Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem</strong>:
      </p>
      <blockquote className="border-l-4 pl-4 mb-6 italic">
        <strong>Theorem:</strong> Every bounded infinite subset of <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}^n" /> has a limit point in <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}^n" />.
      </blockquote>

      <p className="mb-6">
        This follows directly from the compactness of <strong>closed and bounded sets</strong> in <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}^n" />. If <InlineMath math="E" /> is a bounded infinite subset, it fits within some compact set (e.g., a closed <InlineMath math="k" />-cell), ensuring the existence of a limit point.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">6. Finite Intersection Property</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Another important characterization of compactness uses the <strong>finite intersection property</strong>:
      </p>
      <blockquote className="border-l-4 pl-4 mb-6 italic">
        <strong>Theorem:</strong> Let <InlineMath math="{K_\alpha}" /> be a collection of compact subsets in a metric space. If the intersection of every finite subcollection of <InlineMath math="{K_\alpha}" /> is non-empty, then the intersection of the entire collection is also non-empty.
      </blockquote>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Connection to Nested Interval Theorem</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        This result generalizes the <strong>Nested Interval Theorem</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>In <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}" />, if you have a sequence of nested closed intervals with diminishing lengths, their intersection contains exactly one point.</li>
        <li>The finite intersection property extends this concept to compact sets in arbitrary metric spaces.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Proof Outline</h3>
      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-6">
        <li>Assume for contradiction that the infinite intersection is empty.</li>
        <li>Since compact sets are closed, their complements are open, forming an <strong>open cover</strong> of the space.</li>
        <li>By compactness, this cover must have a finite subcover, but this finite subcover would contradict the hypothesis that finite intersections are non-empty.</li>
      </ol>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Thus, the infinite intersection cannot be empty.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">7. Conclusion</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Compactness ties together several foundational concepts in analysis:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>In <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}^n" />, compact sets are <strong>closed and bounded</strong>.</li>
        <li>In metric spaces, compact sets ensure that every infinite subset has a <strong>limit point</strong>.</li>
        <li>The <strong>finite intersection property</strong> offers another powerful way to think about compactness.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        These characterizations provide versatile tools for proving convergence, continuity, and completeness in more advanced mathematical settings.
