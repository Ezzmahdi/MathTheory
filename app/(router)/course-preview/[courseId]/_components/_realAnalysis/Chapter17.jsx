      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Chapter 17: The Completion of Metric Spaces</h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In our journey through the fascinating world of metric spaces, we've encountered the idea of Cauchy sequences — sequences where the terms get arbitrarily close to each other as the sequence progresses. We’ve also explored the concept of completeness, where every Cauchy sequence converges to a point within the space. But what if a space isn’t complete? Can we still make sense of its “missing points” in some way? This chapter addresses these questions by diving into a beautiful and powerful concept: the <em>completion</em> of a metric space.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">What Happens When a Space Isn’t Complete?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Let’s start by revisiting the rational numbers <InlineMath math="\mathbb{Q}" />. We know that <InlineMath math="\mathbb{Q}" /> isn’t complete because there are Cauchy sequences of rational numbers that don’t converge to a rational number. For instance, the sequence:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="x_n = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \dots + \frac{1}{n}" />
      <p className="mb-4">
        is Cauchy but doesn’t converge to a rational number. Instead, it converges to a real number.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Now, here’s a natural question:
      </p>
      <blockquote className="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gray-400 italic mb-4">
        <strong>If a space like <InlineMath math="\mathbb{Q}" /> isn’t complete, can it be “extended” or “embedded” into a larger space that is complete?</strong>
      </blockquote>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The answer is <em>yes</em>! The rational numbers can be embedded in the real numbers <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}" />, which <em>is</em> complete. This process of embedding <InlineMath math="\mathbb{Q}" /> into <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}" /> gives us a glimpse of what we mean by <em>completion</em>.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        But what about other metric spaces? Can we always find a similar “completion” for any incomplete metric space? Thankfully, the answer is once again <em>yes</em>, and this brings us to one of the most beautiful theorems in mathematics.
      </p>

      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">The Completion Theorem</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Theorem:</strong> Every metric space <InlineMath math="(X, d)" /> has a <em>completion</em>, which we will denote as <InlineMath math="(X^*, d^*)" />.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The completion <InlineMath math="X^*" /> is a complete metric space that contains <InlineMath math="X" /> as a dense subset. Moreover, the metric <InlineMath math="d^*" /> on <InlineMath math="X^*" /> extends the metric <InlineMath math="d" /> on <InlineMath math="X" />, meaning that distances between points in <InlineMath math="X" /> are preserved in <InlineMath math="X^*" />.
      </p>

      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Building the Completion: The Key Ideas</h2>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">1. Start with Cauchy Sequences</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The first step is to consider all possible Cauchy sequences in the original space <InlineMath math="X" />. Let’s denote the set of all Cauchy sequences in <InlineMath math="X" /> as:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="X^* = \{ \text{Cauchy sequences in } X \}" />
      <p className="mb-4">
        For example, if <InlineMath math="X" /> is the set of rational numbers <InlineMath math="\mathbb{Q}" />, then <InlineMath math="X^*" /> includes sequences like:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="(1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, \dots)" />
      <p className="mb-4">
        which converges to <InlineMath math="\sqrt{2}" />, a point not in <InlineMath math="\mathbb{Q}" />.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">2. Handle Redundancy with an Equivalence Relation</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The problem with just taking all Cauchy sequences is that many of them “represent” the same point. For instance, in <InlineMath math="\mathbb{Q}" />, both the sequences:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="\left(1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, \dots\right) \quad \text{and} \quad \left(1.5, 1.42, 1.415, 1.4141, \dots\right)" />
      <p className="mb-4">
        converge to <InlineMath math="\sqrt{2}" />. We don’t want to treat these as different points in our completed space.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To fix this, we introduce an equivalence relation: two Cauchy sequences <InlineMath math="(p_n)" /> and <InlineMath math="(q_n)" /> are considered <em>equivalent</em> if the distance between them goes to zero as <InlineMath math="n" /> goes to infinity. Formally:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="(p_n) \sim (q_n) \quad \text{if} \quad \lim_{n \to \infty} d(p_n, q_n) = 0" />

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">3. Define a Metric on the Completion</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Now that we’ve identified which sequences are equivalent, we can define a metric on the set of equivalence classes. Let <InlineMath math="[p_n]" /> and <InlineMath math="[q_n]" /> be two equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences. We define the distance between these classes as:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="d^*([p_n], [q_n]) = \lim_{n \to \infty} d(p_n, q_n)" />

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">4. Verify Completeness</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The final step is to show that the space <InlineMath math="(X^*, d^*)" /> is complete. This involves proving that every Cauchy sequence of equivalence classes in <InlineMath math="X^*" /> converges to a limit within <InlineMath math="X^*" />. The details of this proof are beyond the scope of this chapter, but the key idea is that the construction ensures completeness.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Embedding <InlineMath math="X" /> into <InlineMath math="X^*" /></h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        An important aspect of this construction is that the original space <InlineMath math="X" /> can be embedded into its completion <InlineMath math="X^*" />. Each point <InlineMath math="x \in X" /> can be associated with the constant sequence:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="(x, x, x, \dots)" />
      <p className="mb-4">
        This sequence is Cauchy, and it represents the same point <InlineMath math="x" /> in <InlineMath math="X^*" />. Thus, <InlineMath math="X" /> is “preserved” as a dense subset of <InlineMath math="X^*" />.
      </p>

      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">An Example: Completing <InlineMath math="\mathbb{Q}" /></h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The rational numbers <InlineMath math="\mathbb{Q}" /> can be completed to form the real numbers <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}" />. The process involves considering all Cauchy sequences of rational numbers and defining equivalence classes as outlined above. This construction leads to a complete space where every Cauchy sequence of rationals converges to a real number.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Monotone Sequences and Their Limits</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Before concluding this chapter, let’s touch on a related topic: <em>monotone sequences</em>.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A sequence <InlineMath math="(a_n)" /> is called <em>monotonically increasing</em> if each term is greater than or equal to the previous term:
      </p>
      <BlockMath math="a_1 \leq a_2 \leq a_3 \leq \dots" />
      <p className="mb-4">
        Similarly, a sequence is <em>monotonically decreasing</em> if each term is less than or equal to the previous term.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Theorem</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Theorem:</strong> Every bounded monotone sequence in <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}" /> converges.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        For example, if a bounded increasing sequence <InlineMath math="(a_n)" /> is bounded above by some number <InlineMath math="M" />, it will converge to its least upper bound, or <em>supremum</em>.
      </p>

      <hr className="my-4" />

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The concept of completion is a profound and elegant idea in mathematics. It allows us to fill in the “gaps” in an incomplete space, ensuring that every Cauchy sequence has a limit. This process not only deepens our understanding of metric spaces but also provides a robust framework for constructing familiar spaces like the real numbers.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The next time you encounter a sequence that seems to be “approaching” something that isn’t in your space, remember: completion is the mathematical way of making those elusive points real.
